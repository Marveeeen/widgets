# Daily Widget Practice (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

Welcome to my **Widgets Repo**, a personal daily practice project where I build small UI components and interactive features using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

---

## Motivation

In a world full of frameworks and libraries, I believe mastering the **fundamentals** is essential for building solid, accessible web applications.  
This project is my commitment to refining the basics by **creating a new widget every day** — completely from scratch, without any frameworks.

Each widget is designed to:

- Reinforce **core web standards** — semantic HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic  
- Deepen my understanding of **DOM manipulation** and browser behavior  
- Apply **accessibility best practices** following **WCAG** guidelines  
- Strengthen **problem-solving** and **implementation** skills through pure logic and structure  

The focus is always on **clean code**, **semantic markup**, and **progressive enhancement**.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Marveeeen/widgets.git
cd widgets
```

Open any widget folder and launch the `index.html` file in your browser to view it.

## Usage

Each widget is a **self-contained mini project** inside its own folder.  
You can explore, modify, or expand any of them to experiment further.

Example folder structure:

```
  ├── carousel/
  │   ├── index.html
  │   ├── style.css
  │   └── script.js
  ├── drag-drop/
  ├── autofill/
  └── ...
```

Every widget demonstrates:
- Semantic markup structure  
- CSS for layout and responsiveness  
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch  
3. Commit your changes  
4. Submit a pull request  

Feedback and discussions around **clean code**, **accessibility**, and **vanilla JS patterns** are highly encouraged.
