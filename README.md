# Daily Widget Practice — HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to my **Widgets Repo** — a personal daily practice project where I build small UI components and interactive features using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

## Why This Project Exists

In a world full of frameworks and libraries, I believe mastering the fundamentals is key to building truly solid and accessible web applications. This repo is my commitment to doing just that — refining the basics by **building a new widget every day**, completely from scratch.

Each widget is designed to:

- Practice and reinforce **core web standards**: semantic HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic
- Deepen my understanding of **DOM manipulation** and browser behavior without relying on frameworks
- Apply **accessibility best practices** following **WCAG** guidelines
- Strengthen my problem-solving and implementation skills using basic logic and structure

Each one is implemented with a focus on **clean code**, **semantic structure**, and **progressive enhancement**.

## Goals & Highlights

- Sharpen core frontend skills by building without abstraction
- Improve attention to accessibility and semantic design
- Enhance JavaScript logic and DOM traversal knowledge
